# Welcome to the LTER GitHub Organization

This meta-repository is meant to help with navigation of the repositories within this organization account. To group similar repositories together we make extensive use of GitHub "[topics](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/classifying-your-repository-with-topics)" and try to use shared repository name components. Both of these--where applicable--are described below in the following sections.

While the description below includes the _primary_ groups of repositories, there are some topics that are in use that are not described. These include `documentation`, `climhydro`, `eml-metadata`, and `lter-site-specific`. There is also an `inactive` topic that we recommend adding to repositories without activity in the last 5 years (or so).
